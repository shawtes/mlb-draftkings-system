```python
def calculate_probability_predictions(model, features, thresholds, n_bootstrap=100):
    """
    Calculate probability predictions using bootstrap sampling for robust uncertainty estimation.
    Returns probabilities for each threshold plus prediction intervals.
    """

## 📊 SAMPLE OUTPUT

### What the System Now Produces:
```csv
Name,Date,Predicted_FPTS,Prob_Over_5,Prob_Over_10,Prob_Over_15,Prob_Over_20,Prob_Over_25,Prediction_Lower_80,Prediction_Upper_80,Prediction_Std
Mike Trout,2025-07-05,18.5,0.95,0.85,0.65,0.35,0.15,12.2,24.8,3.2
Ronald Acuña Jr.,2025-07-05,22.3,0.98,0.92,0.78,0.58,0.35,16.1,28.5,3.8
```

### Probability Interpretation:
- **P(FPTS > 15) ≥ 70%**: HIGH CONFIDENCE - Strong cash game play
- **P(FPTS > 15) ≥ 40%**: MODERATE CONFIDENCE - Good tournament play  
- **P(FPTS > 15) < 40%**: LOW CONFIDENCE - GPP punt play only
