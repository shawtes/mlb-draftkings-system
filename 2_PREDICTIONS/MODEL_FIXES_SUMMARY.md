# Critical Model Prediction Fixes Applied

## Issue Summary
The prediction script was not working properly due to several mismatches between the training script and prediction script. Here are the key issues identified and fixed:

## 1. Path Mismatches ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Training script saves models/encoders in `1_CORE_TRAINING/` directory, but prediction script was looking in `3_MODELS/`
**Fix**: Updated paths in prediction script to match training script locations:
- `label_encoder_name_sep2.pkl`
- `label_encoder_team_sep2.pkl`
- `batters_final_ensemble_model_pipeline.pkl`

## 2. Feature Engineering Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Prediction script had extra features not in training script
**Fix**: Removed `5_game_avg` calculation and references - this feature doesn't exist in training script

## 3. Pipeline Usage Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Prediction script was manually extracting pipeline steps and calling them separately
**Fix**: Updated `process_predictions()` to use the complete pipeline with `pipeline.predict(features)` instead of manually calling preprocessor→selector→model

## 4. Label Encoder Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Prediction script was manually expanding encoder classes, causing compatibility issues
**Fix**: Updated to use training script's approach of recreating encoders when compatibility issues arise

## 5. Categorical Feature Encoding ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Prediction script was overriding proper categorical encoding
**Fix**: Removed lines that set `df['team_encoded'] = df['Team']` and `df['Name_encoded'] = df['Name']` - let pipeline handle encoding

## 6. Scaler Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Prediction script was trying to load separate scaler
**Fix**: Removed manual scaler loading since the pipeline handles all preprocessing internally

## 7. Probability Prediction Updates ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Probability prediction function was trying to extract pipeline components
**Fix**: Updated to work with complete pipeline

## Expected Results After Fixes:
1. ✅ Model should load successfully from correct path
2. ✅ Feature engineering should match training exactly
3. ✅ Pipeline should handle all preprocessing/scaling/selection automatically
4. ✅ Predictions should be realistic and consistent
5. ✅ No more feature mismatch errors

## Files Modified:
- `predction01.py` - Applied all fixes above

## Next Steps:
1. Run the prediction script to verify fixes work
2. Compare prediction outputs with training data to validate accuracy
3. Test with different prediction dates to ensure stability

## Key Takeaway:
The main issue was that the prediction script was trying to replicate the training pipeline manually instead of using the saved complete pipeline. The complete pipeline already includes all preprocessing, feature selection, and scaling steps.
