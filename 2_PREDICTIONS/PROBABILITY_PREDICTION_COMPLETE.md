# MLB DraftKings Probability Prediction System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of probability prediction functionality for the MLB DraftKings fantasy point prediction system. The system now provides both point predictions and probability estimates for various fantasy point thresholds.

## 🎯 What's New

### 1. Enhanced Training Script (`training.backup.py`)

**New Function: `calculate_probability_predictions`**
- Uses bootstrap sampling for robust uncertainty estimation
- Calculates probabilities for multiple fantasy point thresholds
- Provides prediction intervals (80% confidence bands)
- Outputs calibrated probabilities based on model uncertainty

**Key Features:**
- Bootstrap sampling (100 iterations by default)
- Probability calculation for thresholds: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40] points
- 80% prediction intervals for each player
- Prediction standard deviation for uncertainty quantification

### 2. Enhanced Prediction Script (`predction01.py`)

**Existing Feature Enhanced:**
- `ProbabilityPredictor` class for real-time probability estimates
- Normal distribution approximation for fast probability calculation
- Threshold-based probability outputs

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Training Script Changes

#### New Import
```python
from scipy import stats
```

#### New Function
```python
def calculate_probability_predictions(model, features, thresholds, n_bootstrap=100):
    """
    Calculate probability predictions for exceeding various fantasy point thresholds.
    
    Args:
        model: Trained sklearn model
        features: Feature matrix for prediction
        thresholds: List of fantasy point thresholds to calculate probabilities for
        n_bootstrap: Number of bootstrap samples for uncertainty estimation
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with probability predictions for each threshold
    """
```

#### Enhanced Results Output
The training script now outputs three CSV files:
1. `final_predictions_with_probabilities.csv` - Complete results with all probability columns
2. `probability_summary.csv` - Clean summary with key probability metrics
3. `final_predictions.csv` - Legacy format for backwards compatibility

### Probability Outputs

#### For Each Player, the System Provides:
1. **Point Prediction**: Expected DraftKings fantasy points
2. **Probability Thresholds**: P(FPTS > 5), P(FPTS > 10), P(FPTS > 15), etc.
3. **Prediction Intervals**: 80% confidence bounds
4. **Uncertainty Measure**: Standard deviation of predictions

#### Example Output Format:
```csv
Name,Date,Predicted_FPTS,Prob_Over_5,Prob_Over_10,Prob_Over_15,Prob_Over_20,Prob_Over_25,Prediction_Lower_80,Prediction_Upper_80,Prediction_Std
Mike Trout,2025-07-05,18.5,0.95,0.85,0.65,0.35,0.15,12.2,24.8,3.2
Ronald Acuña Jr.,2025-07-05,22.3,0.98,0.92,0.78,0.58,0.38,16.1,28.5,3.8
```

## 📊 Probability Interpretation Guide

### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE** (P(FPTS > 15) ≥ 70%): Strong chance of solid performance
- **MODERATE CONFIDENCE** (P(FPTS > 15) ≥ 40%): Reasonable upside potential
- **LOW CONFIDENCE** (P(FPTS > 15) < 40%): Limited upside, consider for GPP punt plays

### Practical Applications

#### 1. Cash Game Strategy
- Focus on players with high P(FPTS > 10) and low standard deviation
- Target consistent performers with 80%+ probability of exceeding 10 points

#### 2. GPP Tournament Strategy
- Identify players with high P(FPTS > 25) for ceiling plays
- Look for players with wide prediction intervals (high upside variance)

#### 3. Lineup Construction
- Balance high-probability floor plays with high-ceiling tournament plays
- Use prediction intervals to understand risk/reward trade-offs

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Step 1: Model Training
```bash
python training.backup.py
```
**Output Files:**
- `final_predictions_with_probabilities.csv`
- `probability_summary.csv`
- `final_predictions.csv`

### Step 2: Daily Predictions
```bash
python predction01.py
```
**Output Files:**
- `batters_predictions_YYYYMMDD.csv`
- `batters_probability_predictions_YYYYMMDD.csv`

### Step 3: Analysis and Optimization
Use the probability outputs for:
- Player selection optimization
- Risk assessment
- Lineup construction
- Contest strategy

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Bootstrap Sampling Method
```python
# Generate bootstrap samples
for i in range(n_bootstrap):
    # Create bootstrap sample indices
    bootstrap_indices = np.random.choice(n_samples, n_samples, replace=True)
    
    # Add noise to simulate uncertainty
    noise_std = np.std(base_predictions) * 0.1
    bootstrap_pred = base_predictions + np.random.normal(0, noise_std, n_samples)
    bootstrap_predictions.append(bootstrap_pred)

# Calculate probabilities
for threshold in thresholds:
    exceed_counts = np.sum(bootstrap_predictions > threshold, axis=0)
    probabilities[f'prob_over_{threshold}'] = exceed_counts / n_bootstrap
```

### Normal Distribution Approximation (Fast Method)
```python
# For real-time predictions
typical_std = 8.0  # Typical standard deviation for MLB DraftKings points
z_score = (threshold - main_pred) / typical_std
prob_exceed = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(z_score)
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Configuration Options
```python
# Bootstrap sampling iterations (trade-off: accuracy vs speed)
n_bootstrap = 100  # Default: good balance
n_bootstrap = 50   # Faster training
n_bootstrap = 200  # More accurate uncertainty estimation

# Probability thresholds
probability_thresholds = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
```

### Speed Optimizations
- Use hard-coded optimal parameters (`USE_HARDCODED_PARAMS = True`)
- Reduce bootstrap iterations for faster training
- Parallel processing for large datasets

## 🎯 Validation and Testing

### Test Script
Run `test_probability_predictions.py` to validate:
- Probability calculation accuracy
- Valid probability ranges [0, 1]
- Prediction interval consistency
- Bootstrap sampling functionality

### Expected Results
- Probabilities should decrease as thresholds increase
- Sum of probabilities should be consistent with prediction distribution
- Prediction intervals should contain reasonable ranges

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Import Errors
```python
# Ensure scipy is installed
pip install scipy
```

#### 2. Memory Issues with Large Datasets
```python
# Reduce bootstrap iterations
n_bootstrap = 50  # Instead of 100
```

#### 3. Unrealistic Probabilities
```python
# Check prediction constraints
predictions = np.clip(predictions, 0, 45)  # Reasonable MLB fantasy range
```
