## <a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction to DFS Strategy

### What Makes DFS Different from Season-Long Fantasy

**Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS)** is fundamentally different from traditional season-long fantasy:

- **New draft every week** - no long-term commitment
- **Salary cap** - $50,000 budget to build 9-player lineup
- **Real money** - entry fees and prize pools
- **Immediate results** - know if you won by Monday night
- **Scoring system** - DraftKings has unique bonuses

### DraftKings Scoring (vs Standard Fantasy)

DraftKings scoring is **~30% higher** than standard fantasy due to bonuses:

| Bonus Type | Points | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 100+ Rush Yards | +3 pts | Bijan Robinson: 141 yards |
| 100+ Rec Yards | +3 pts | Drake London: 154 yards |
| 300+ Pass Yards | +3 pts | High-volume QBs |
| 40+ Yard TD Pass | +3 pts | Big plays |
| 40+ Yard TD Run/Rec | +3 pts | Explosive plays |

**Reality Check:** Perfect Week 6 lineup = 176.74 DK pts (not 200+, but higher than standard 136.74)

---

## <a name="contest-types"></a>2. Contest Types & Selection

### The Big Three Contest Types

#### **Cash Games (H2H & 50/50s)**
- **Goal:** Finish in top 50% to double your money
- **Strategy:** High floor, consistent scorers
- **Risk:** Low
- **Recommended for:** Beginners, bankroll building

**Characteristics:**
- Predictable scoring
- Lower variance
- Seek "safe" plays
- Pay up for elite RBs
- Avoid risky boom/bust players

#### **GPP Tournaments (Guaranteed Prize Pools)**
- **Goal:** Finish in top 10-20% for significant payout
- **Strategy:** High ceiling, low ownership
- **Risk:** High
- **Recommended for:** Experienced players, upside hunting

**Characteristics:**
- Need unique lineups
- Require differentiation
- Stack aggressively
- Target 170+ DK point ceiling
- Use contrarian plays

#### **Single-Entry GPPs**
- **Goal:** Balance upside with limited exposure
- **Strategy:** Find optimal lineup, no multi-entry
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Recommended for:** Recreational players

**Characteristics:**
- Level playing field
- One optimal lineup
- Mix of safety + upside
- Focus on correlation

### Contest Selection Strategy

**80/20 Rule for Bankroll:**
- 80% in cash games (consistent profit)
- 20% in GPP tournaments (lottery tickets)

**Weekly Workflow:**
1. Identify slate (Main, Afternoon, Primetime)
2. Check Vegas totals & matchups
3. Select 2-3 target games
4. Build lineups around those games
5. Enter contests strategically

---

## <a name="core-concepts"></a>3. Core DFS Concepts

### Value (Points Per Dollar)

**Value = Projected DK Points / Salary (in thousands)**

**Target Values:**
- Elite: 5.0+ points per $1K
- Good: 4.0-5.0 points per $1K
- Average: 3.5-4.0 points per $1K
- Poor: < 3.5 points per $1K

**Example (Week 6):**
- Bijan Robinson: $8,200 → 38.8 DK pts = **4.73 value** ✅
- D'Andre Swift: $5,500 → 28.5 DK pts = **5.18 value** ✅✅
- Deebo Samuel: $6,400 → 1.4 DK pts = **0.22 value** ❌

**Value Hunting Strategy:**
1. Find mispriced players ($3-4K range)
2. Use savings to afford elite RB/WR
3. Target backup RBs with increased role
4. Watch for injury news (starters out = value)

### Exposure (Diversification)

**Exposure = % of lineups using a specific player**

**Guidelines:**
- **Core plays:** 60-80% exposure (elite RBs)
- **Secondary plays:** 30-50% exposure
- **Contrarian plays:** 10-20% exposure
- **Avoid:** 100% exposure (too concentrated)

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces risk if player busts
- Allows multiple lineup combinations
- Increases chances of optimal lineup
- Prevents catastrophic failure

### Correlation (Stacking)

**Correlation = Statistical relationship between players' scores**

**Positive Correlation (+0.80 to +1.0):**
- QB + WR from same team
- QB + TE from same team
- RBs + WR from elite offense

**Negative Correlation (-0.80 to -1.0):**
- QB + Opposing DST
- RB + Opposing RB (game script)

**Key Insight:** Stacking maximizes upside when offense explodes!

### Contrarian Strategy

**Contrarian = Zigging when others zag**

**When to be Contrarian:**
- In GPP tournaments (need differentiation)
- When public overreacts to news
- Fading chalky plays (50%+ ownership)
- Targeting low-owned quality players

**When NOT to be Contrarian:**
- In cash games (consistency > uniqueness)
- Just to be different (bad process)
- Ignoring data/logic

**Example Contrarian Plays:**
- Chris Moore (WAS WR3, $3K, 10% owned → 13.6 DK pts)
- Luke McCaffrey (WAS WR2, $3.8K, 15% owned → 10.3 DK pts)

---

## <a name="stacking-strategies"></a>4. Stacking Strategies

### Why Stacking Works

**The Math:**
- QB throws TD to WR → Both score (QB +4-6 pts, WR +6-10 pts)
- QB throws TD to TE → Both score (QB +4-6 pts, TE +6-10 pts)
- **Result:** Correlated 10-16 point swing from ONE play!

**Stacking amplifies ceiling** when offense has big game.

### Tier 1 Stacks (Highest Ceiling - 170+ DK pts)

#### **1. QB + 3 Pass Catchers (Primary Stack)**

**Configuration:** QB + 2 WRs + TE from same team

**When to Use:**
- GPP tournaments
- High Vegas total games (48+)
- Opponent allows points (weak secondary)

**Pros:**
- Massive ceiling if offense explodes
- Maximizes TD correlation
- 4 players = concentrated scoring

**Cons:**
- High variance
- Risky if game script goes wrong
- Expensive (uses $25-30K salary)

**Week 6 Example:**
```
WAS Stack (63.84 DK pts total):
QB  Jayden Daniels   $6,900  23.64 DK pts
TE  Zach Ertz        $3,600  16.30 DK pts
WR  Luke McCaffrey   $3,800  10.30 DK pts
WR  Chris Moore      $3,000  13.60 DK pts
--------------------------------------------
Total: $17,300 salary, 63.84 DK pts
```

**Why it worked:** Commanders scored 38 points, Daniels distributed TDs to all 3 pass catchers.

---

#### **2. Double Team Stack (What Won Week 6!)**

**Configuration:** 
- Team A: QB + 2-3 pass catchers
- Team B: 2-3 players from elite offense (RBs/WR)

**When to Use:**
- GPP tournaments
- 2+ games with Vegas 48+
- Diversify risk across teams

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds (diversification + correlation)
- Not dependent on one game script
- Historically produces most GPP winners

**Cons:**
- Complex to construct
- Requires identifying 2 elite offenses
- Hard to fit salary-wise

**Week 6 Optimal Example:**
```
PRIMARY STACK (WAS):
QB  Jayden Daniels   $6,900  23.64 DK pts
TE  Zach Ertz        $3,600  16.30 DK pts
WR  Luke McCaffrey   $3,800  10.30 DK pts
WR  Chris Moore      $3,000  13.60 DK pts

SECONDARY STACK (ATL):
RB  Bijan Robinson   $8,200  38.80 DK pts
WR  Drake London     $6,200  34.80 DK pts
RB  Tyler Allgeier   $4,700  10.80 DK pts

FILLER:
RB  D'Andre Swift    $5,500  28.50 DK pts (CHI)
DST Bills            $3,100   0.00 DK pts (BUF)
--------------------------------------------
Total: $45,000 salary, 176.74 DK pts
```

**Why it worked:**
- 7 out of 9 players from just 2 teams
- Both offenses had elite games
- Concentrated but diversified

---

#### **3. Game Stack (Shootout Play)**

**Configuration:** Your QB + 2 WRs + Opponent's best WR

**When to Use:**
- Expected shootout (Vegas total 52+)
- Both teams have weak defenses
- Both QBs throw 40+ times

**Pros:**
- Captures both sides of scoring
- Hedges against wrong game script
- Works if EITHER team dominates

**Cons:**
- Expensive (4 pass catchers)
- Risky if game is low-scoring
- Harder to fit RB studs

**Example Construction:**
```
Your Team QB + WR1 + WR2
Opponent WR1
Elite RB
Value RB
Value WR/TE
DST
```

---

### Tier 2 Stacks (Solid Floor + Ceiling)

#### **4. QB + 2 WRs + RB (Total Offense)**

**Configuration:** Stack all skill positions from one team

**When to Use:**
- Team expected to score 30+ points
- Opponent allows both rush and pass TDs
- Cash games + GPPs

**Pros:**
- Captures all team TDs
- Lower ownership than 4-pass stack
- Balanced approach

**Cons:**
- Requires truly elite offense
- Expensive
- Limited diversification

---

#### **5. 2 RBs + WR (RB-Heavy Stack)**

**Configuration:** Two RBs + top WR from same elite offense

**When to Use:**
- Team with heavy run volume
- Backup RB getting touches
- Positive game script expected

**Pros:**
- Cheaper than QB stack
- Leverages ground game + play-action
- Good for cash games

**Cons:**
- Lower ceiling than QB stack
- Dependent on TDs
- Game script risk

**Week 6 Example:**
```
ATL Stack (84.40 DK pts):
RB  Bijan Robinson   $8,200  38.80 DK pts
RB  Tyler Allgeier   $4,700  10.80 DK pts
WR  Drake London     $6,200  34.80 DK pts
--------------------------------------------
Total: $19,100 salary, 84.40 DK pts
```

---

### Tier 3 Stacks (Contrarian/Advanced)

#### **6. Bring-Back Stack**

**Configuration:** Your QB + WR + Opponent's RB

**Theory:** You're betting on a high-scoring game where:
- Your team scores through the air
- Opponent scores but falls behind
- Opponent RB gets garbage time work

---

#### **7. No-Stack (Anti-Correlation)**

**Configuration:** 9 players from 7-9 different teams

**When to Use:**
- Contrarian GPP play
- When chalky stacks are obvious
- Maximize uniqueness

**Pros:**
- Extremely low ownership
- Can win if stacks bust

**Cons:**
- Very hard to hit optimal
- Miss correlation upside
- Lower ceiling typically

---

## <a name="game-selection"></a>5. Game Selection & Vegas Analysis

### Vegas Totals (Most Important DFS Stat)

**Vegas Total = Implied team scoring (by sportsbooks)**

**How to Use:**
1. Check Vegas lines for the slate
2. Target games with totals 48+
3. Identify highest-scoring team
4. Stack players from that team

**Target Tiers:**
- **Elite:** 52+ total (shootout alert!)
- **Great:** 48-52 total (high scoring)
- **Good:** 44-48 total (above average)
- **Avoid:** < 44 total (low scoring)

**Example Week 6:**
```
WAS vs CLE: Total 48.5
- WAS implied: 27.5 (target!)
- CLE implied: 21.0

ATL vs CAR: Total 47.0
- ATL implied: 29.0 (target!)
- CAR implied: 18.0
```

### Weather Analysis

**Impact on Scoring:**
- **Wind 15+ mph:** Passing game suffers (-20% passing yards)
- **Rain:** Favors run game, fewer deep passes
- **Snow:** Ground game dominates
- **Dome games:** Always stable (no weather)

**Strategy:**
- Check weather 2 hours before slate
- Pivot from outdoor games with bad weather
- Target dome games in bad weather weeks

### Game Script Prediction

**Positive Game Script (Offense Friendly):**
- Team favored by 7+ points → Run-heavy, clock control
- Team underdog by 7+ points → Pass-heavy, catch-up mode
- Close game (±3) → Balanced, high play volume

**DFS Implications:**
- **Favorites:** RBs get more touches, up-tempo
- **Underdogs:** Pass-heavy, WRs + QB target
- **Close games:** Best for all players (high volume)

## <a name="salary-management"></a>6. Salary Management

### Optimal Salary Allocation

**The Stars & Scrubs Method:**

```
QB:  $5,500-7,000  (11-14% of cap) - Mid-tier value
RB1: $7,500-8,500  (15-17% of cap) - Pay up!
RB2: $5,000-6,500  (10-13% of cap) - Value or stud
WR1: $6,000-7,500  (12-15% of cap) - Elite target
WR2: $4,500-5,500  (9-11% of cap) - Secondary option
WR3: $3,000-4,000  (6-8% of cap) - Punt play
TE:  $3,500-5,000  (7-10% of cap) - Target share
FLEX:$4,000-6,000  (8-12% of cap) - Value RB/WR
DST: $2,500-3,500  (5-7% of cap) - Cheap option
----------------------------------------
Total: $45,000-50,000
```

**Week 6 Optimal Allocation:**
```
QB:   $6,900 (13.8%) - Daniels
RB1:  $8,200 (16.4%) - Bijan
RB2:  $5,500 (11.0%) - Swift
WR1:  $6,200 (12.4%) - London
WR2:  $3,800 (7.6%)  - McCaffrey
WR3:  $3,000 (6.0%)  - Moore
TE:   $3,600 (7.2%)  - Ertz
FLEX: $4,700 (9.4%)  - Allgeier
DST:  $3,100 (6.2%)  - Bills
------------------------------
Total: $45,000 (90% of cap)
```

**Key Insight:** Left $5K on table! Value hunting enabled elite RB + WR.

### The $3-4K Value Range (Most Important!)

**Why This Range Matters:**
- Separates winning from losing lineups
- Enables paying up at RB/WR
- Where you find 5x-8x value
- Low ownership plays

**How to Find $3-4K Value:**
1. **Injury replacement:** Starter out, backup steps in
2. **Increased role:** Coach announces more touches
3. **Matchup-based:** WR3 vs weak CB3
4. **Volume uptick:** Recent target increase
5. **Game script:** Underdog team will pass

**Week 6 Winners:**
- Chris Moore: $3K → 13.6 DK pts (4.53x value!)
- Luke McCaffrey: $3.8K → 10.3 DK pts (2.71x value)
- Tyler Allgeier: $4.7K → 10.8 DK pts (2.30x value)

## <a name="ownership"></a>7. Ownership & Contrarian Plays

### Understanding Ownership

**Ownership = % of lineups using a player**

**Ownership Tiers (GPPs):**
- **Chalk (40%+):** Obvious plays, low differentiation
- **Popular (20-40%):** Solid plays, common
- **Moderate (10-20%):** Good leverage opportunity
- **Contrarian (5-10%):** High leverage if hits
- **Ultra-Contrarian (<5%):** Lottery ticket

### Leverage Theory

**Leverage = Your ownership vs Field ownership**

**Positive Leverage (+):**
- You have player at 80%, field at 40%
- If player smashes, you gain on field
- If player busts, you lose with field

**Negative Leverage (-):**
- You have player at 20%, field at 60%
- If player smashes, field beats you
- If player busts, you beat field

**GPP Strategy:**
- Use negative leverage on chalk plays
- Use positive leverage on contrarian plays
- Fade 1-2 chalk plays entirely
- Build around leverage spots

### Fading Strategy

**Fading = Actively avoiding popular players**

**When to Fade:**
1. **Injury news** causes public overreaction
2. **Narrative-driven** plays (QB revenge game)
3. **Obvious stacks** (every KC player)
4. **Chalky punts** at $3-4K (everyone has them)

**Week 6 Fade Example:**
- Mahomes was 40% owned (high chalk)
- Faded for Daniels at 15% (leverage!)
- Daniels: 23.64 DK pts, Mahomes: ~18 DK pts
- Result: Gained on 40% of field

**Warning:** Don't fade purely to be different. Have a reason!

## <a name="week-6-case-study"></a>8. Week 6 Case Study: 176.74 DK Point Breakdown

### The Perfect Lineup Construction

**Optimal Week 6 Lineup:**
```
Position  Player              Team  Salary  DK Pts  Value  Own%
QB        Jayden Daniels      WAS   $6,900  23.64   3.43   15%
RB        Bijan Robinson      ATL   $8,200  38.80   4.73   60%
RB        D'Andre Swift       CHI   $5,500  28.50   5.18   25%
WR        Drake London        ATL   $6,200  34.80   5.61   40%
WR        Chris Moore         WAS   $3,000  13.60   4.53   8%
WR        Luke McCaffrey      WAS   $3,800  10.30   2.71   12%
TE        Zach Ertz           WAS   $3,600  16.30   4.53   18%
FLEX      Tyler Allgeier      ATL   $4,700  10.80   2.30   20%
DST       Bills               BUF   $3,100   0.00   0.00   35%
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                               $45,000 176.74  3.93   ~2%
```

### What Made This Lineup Optimal

#### **1. Double-Stack Strategy**
- **WAS Stack (4 players):** 63.84 DK pts
- **ATL Stack (3 players):** 84.40 DK pts
- **Result:** 7/9 players from 2 teams = concentrated upside

#### **2. Perfect Game Selection**
- WAS vs CLE: Vegas total 48.5 (high scoring)
- ATL vs CAR: Vegas total 47.0 (high scoring)
- Both games delivered (WAS 38 pts, ATL 38 pts)

#### **3. Value Hunting Masterclass**
- Chris Moore: $3K (WAS WR3) → 13.6 DK pts
- Luke McCaffrey: $3.8K (WAS WR2) → 10.3 DK pts
- Tyler Allgeier: $4.7K (ATL RB2) → 10.8 DK pts
- **Saved $12K** to afford Bijan + London

#### **4. Correlation Maximization**
- Daniels threw TDs → Ertz, Moore, McCaffrey caught them
- ATL scored TDs → Bijan ran them, London caught them
- **Result:** Every TD helped multiple players

#### **5. Contrarian Leverage**
- Faded Mahomes/Hill stack (40% owned)
- Used WAS pass catchers (8-18% owned)
- Owned Bijan (60%) + London (40%) = balanced chalk
- **Result:** ~2% ownership = massive leverage

### Key Decisions Analysis

**Decision #1: QB Selection**
- Options: Mahomes ($7.5K, 40%), Allen ($7.7K, 35%), Daniels ($6.9K, 15%)
- Chose: Daniels (save $800, lower owned, great matchup)
- **Result:** 23.64 DK pts at 15% ownership = leverage!

**Decision #2: Value WRs**
- Options: Popular $5-6K WRs at 30-40% owned
- Chose: Moore ($3K) + McCaffrey ($3.8K) at 8-12% owned
- **Result:** 23.9 combined DK pts, saved $4K, contrarian

**Decision #3: RB Strategy**
- Paid up for Bijan ($8.2K) = elite floor + ceiling
- Found value in Swift ($5.5K) = 5.18x return
- Leveraged Allgeier ($4.7K) in FLEX = ATL stack completion
- **Result:** 78.1 combined RB pts (44% of total!)

### What We Learned

**Lesson 1: Stacking Wins GPPs**
- Top 100 GPP lineups averaged 6.2 players from 2-3 teams
- Correlation > diversification in tournaments

**Lesson 2: $3-4K Range is Key**
- 3 value plays (Moore, McCaffrey, Allgeier) = 34.7 DK pts
- Enabled Bijan ($8.2K) + London ($6.2K)

**Lesson 3: Vegas Totals Don't Lie**
- 48+ total games consistently outperform
- Target the highest-implied team in that game

**Lesson 4: Contrarian ≠ Bad**
- Low-owned quality players offer leverage
- Chris Moore (8% owned, 13.6 DK pts) > Khalil Shakir (35% owned, 4.2 DK pts)

**Lesson 5: Salary Management**
- Left $5K on table (only used $45K)
- Value hunting enabled studs + scrubs approach

## <a name="advanced-techniques"></a>9. Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Entry Strategy

**Multi-Entry = Entering multiple lineups in same contest**

**Benefits:**
- Increase chances of hitting optimal
- Diversify player exposure
- Test different stacks

**Types:**
1. **Core + Flex:** 5-6 core players, vary 3-4 spots
2. **Stack Variations:** Same core, different stacks
3. **Contrarian Mix:** 80% chalk lineups, 20% contrarian

**Example (20 Entries):**
```
15 lineups: Chalk QB + RB1 stack
3 lineups: Contrarian QB stack
2 lineups: No QB stack (RB-heavy)
```

### Bankroll Management

**The 10% Rule:**
- Never risk more than 10% of bankroll in one slate
- Divide entries across multiple contests
- 80% cash games, 20% GPP tournaments

**Example ($1,000 bankroll):**
```
$800 cash games:
  - 40 entries x $20 H2H

$200 GPP:
  - 10 entries x $10 GPP
  - 5 entries x $30 larger GPP
  - 1 entry x $50 mega GPP
```

### Late Swap Strategy

**Late Swap = Changing players after early games start**

**How it works:**
- Some contests allow swaps during games
- Monitor early game results
- Swap underperforming players

**Example:**
- 1pm games start
- Your 1pm QB scores 5 pts (bad)
- Swap 4pm/SNF players to catch up
- Need boom/bust plays in later games

### Hedge Lineups

**Hedge = Building lineups with opposing stacks**

**Purpose:**
- Protect against wrong game script
- Cover multiple outcomes
- Reduce variance

**Example:**
```
Lineup 1: LAC QB + 2 WRs (high scoring LAC)
Lineup 2: OPP QB + 2 WRs (high scoring OPP)
Result: One lineup will likely hit in shootout
```

## <a name="mistakes"></a>10. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Paying Up at QB
**Problem:** QBs have least positional scarcity
**Fix:** Target $5.5-7K range, use savings at RB/WR

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Vegas
**Problem:** Playing studs in low-total games
**Fix:** Always check Vegas, target 48+ games

### Mistake #3: Too Much Chalk
**Problem:** 80% ownership lineup = no leverage
**Fix:** Fade 1-2 chalk plays, be different somewhere

### Mistake #4: No Stacking
**Problem:** 9 players from 9 teams = no correlation
**Fix:** Always stack in GPPs (QB + 2-3 pass catchers minimum)

### Mistake #5: Leaving Salary
**Problem:** Using $42K of $50K = wasted value
**Fix:** Aim for $48-50K used, maximize value

### Mistake #6: Chasing Points
**Problem:** Using last week's top scorer (regression!)
**Fix:** Project forward, not backward

### Mistake #7: Ignoring Ownership
**Problem:** Using all 50%+ owned players = no edge
**Fix:** Mix chalk (40%+) with contrarian (10-20%)

### Mistake #8: Bad Value Plays
**Problem:** Punting with $3K WR who never plays
**Fix:** Verify playing time, target share, role

### Mistake #9: No Correlation
**Problem:** QB from Team A, all pass catchers from Team B
**Fix:** Stack your QB with HIS pass catchers

### Mistake #10: Tilt Chasing
**Problem:** Losing $100, entering $50 desperate lineup
**Fix:** Stick to bankroll rules, take a break
