# Exact Lineup Count Fix - Generate Exactly What User Requests

## Problem
The optimizer was generating **WAY TOO MANY lineups** (e.g., 2,928 lineups when user requested 5).

### Root Cause
When generating lineups for **multiple team combinations**, the optimizer was:
1. Generating requested count (e.g., 5) **PER combination**
2. If user had 500+ combinations selected, it would generate 5 × 500+ = 2,500+ lineups
3. No total limit was enforced

Example:
- User requests: **5 lineups total**
- User selects: **500 combinations**
- Old behavior: Generates 5 per combo = **2,500 lineups** ❌
- New behavior: Distributes 5 across all combos = **5 lineups** ✅

## Solution Applied

### Fix #1: Get Total Requested from GUI (Lines 2448-2456)
```python
# BEFORE: Used per-combo count from table
for teams, stack_sizes, lineups_count in selected_combinations:

# AFTER: Get total from GUI and distribute
total_requested = self.get_requested_lineups()  # e.g., 5 total
num_combinations = len(selected_combinations)   # e.g., 500 combos
lineups_per_combo = max(1, total_requested // num_combinations)  # 5 // 500 = 0, use 1
extra_lineups = total_requested % num_combinations  # 5 % 500 = 5
```

**Impact:** Now knows the TOTAL requested, not per-combo.

### Fix #2: Distribute Lineups Across Combinations (Lines 2458-2470)
```python
for combo_idx, (teams, stack_sizes, lineups_count) in enumerate(selected_combinations):
    # Use distributed count instead of per-combo table value
    current_combo_count = lineups_per_combo
    if combo_idx < extra_lineups:
        current_combo_count += 1  # Give extra lineup to first N combos
    
    # Stop if we've reached the total requested
    if len(all_lineups) >= total_requested:
        logging.info(f"✅ Reached total requested lineups ({total_requested}), stopping")
        break
```

**Impact:** 
- First 5 combos get 1 lineup each = 5 total
- Remaining 495 combos are skipped
- Stops immediately when total is reached

### Fix #3: Update Worker Lineup Count (Line 2519)
```python
# BEFORE:
num_lineups=max(lineups_count, 10),  # Was using old per-combo count

# AFTER:
num_lineups=max(current_combo_count, 5),  # Use distributed count for this combo
```

**Impact:** Worker now generates correct count for each combo.

### Fix #4: Update Stop Condition (Line 2547)
```python
# BEFORE:
if len(all_combo_results) >= lineups_count:

# AFTER:
if len(all_combo_results) >= current_combo_count:
```

**Impact:** Stops generating when this combo's allocation is reached.

### Fix #5: Limit Combo Lineups (Lines 2576-2586)
```python
# BEFORE: Would fill deficit by duplicating
if len(combo_lineups) < lineups_count and len(combo_lineups) > 0:
    # ... duplicate lineups ...

# AFTER: Hard limit and respect total
combo_lineups = combo_lineups[:current_combo_count]

remaining_slots = total_requested - len(all_lineups)
if remaining_slots > 0:
    lineups_to_add = combo_lineups[:remaining_slots]
    all_lineups.extend(lineups_to_add)
    logging.info(f"✅ Added {len(lineups_to_add)} lineups (total now: {len(all_lineups)}/{total_requested})")
else:
    logging.info(f"⏸️ Skipping combo - already at total requested")
```

**Impact:** 
- No duplication
- Respects remaining slots
- Skips combos if total already reached

### Fix #6: Final Safety Limit (Lines 2599-2601)
```python
if all_lineups and len(all_lineups) > 0:
    # FINAL SAFETY: Limit to exact requested count
    all_lineups = all_lineups[:total_requested]
    logging.info(f"🎯 FINAL COUNT: Storing exactly {len(all_lineups)} lineups (requested: {total_requested})")
    
    self.optimized_lineups = all_lineups
```

**Impact:** Final guarantee that exact count is stored.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Requests 5 Lineups, Selects 500 Combinations

**Old Behavior:**
- Combo 1: 5 lineups
- Combo 2: 5 lineups
- ...
- Combo 500: 5 lineups
- **Total: 2,500 lineups** ❌

**New Behavior:**
- Combo 1: 1 lineup ✅
- Combo 2: 1 lineup ✅
- Combo 3: 1 lineup ✅
- Combo 4: 1 lineup ✅
- Combo 5: 1 lineup ✅
- Combo 6-500: Skipped (already at 5)
- **Total: 5 lineups** ✅

### Scenario 2: User Requests 100 Lineups, Selects 10 Combinations

**Distribution:**
- 100 ÷ 10 = 10 lineups per combo
- Each combo gets 10 lineups
- **Total: 100 lineups** ✅

### Scenario 3: User Requests 7 Lineups, Selects 3 Combinations

**Distribution:**
- 7 ÷ 3 = 2 per combo, with 1 extra
- Combo 1: 3 lineups (2 + 1 extra)
- Combo 2: 2 lineups
- Combo 3: 2 lineups
- **Total: 7 lineups** ✅

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with GUI input:**
   - Set "Number of Lineups" to 5
   - Select multiple combinations
   - Generate and export
   - **Expected:** Exactly 5 lineups in CSV

2. **Test with different combinations:**
   - 1 combo with 10 requested → 10 lineups
   - 5 combos with 10 requested → 10 lineups (2 per combo)
   - 100 combos with 5 requested → 5 lineups (0-1 per combo)

3. **Check logs:**
   - Should see: "🎯 TOTAL LINEUPS REQUESTED: X across all combinations"
   - Should see: "📊 DISTRIBUTION: Y lineups per combo, Z extra"
   - Should see: "🎯 FINAL COUNT: Storing exactly X lineups"

## Lines Changed
- 2448-2456: Get total requested and calculate distribution
- 2458-2470: Use distributed count per combo and add stop condition
- 2519: Update worker num_lineups parameter
- 2547: Update stop condition for attempts
- 2554: Update debug logging
- 2576-2586: Limit combo lineups and respect total
- 2599-2601: Final safety limit before storing

## Result
✅ User requests 5 lineups → Gets exactly 5 lineups
✅ User requests 100 lineups → Gets exactly 100 lineups
✅ Works with any number of combinations selected
✅ No more exponential lineup generation!
