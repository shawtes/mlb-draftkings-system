- Conservative stacking
- Focus: Top 50% finish

**GPP Tournament:**
- Uses **ceiling** projections (upside)
- Contrarian boosts (+15-25%)
- Lower exposure limits (20%)
- Aggressive stacking
- Focus: Top 1-10% finish

### 2. Advanced Stacking
**6 Stack Types:**

### 3. Contrarian Engine
**GPP Ownership Adjustments:**
- Leverage (<5% own): +25% boost
- Low (<8% own): +15% boost
- Medium (8-15%): No change
- High (15-25%): No penalty

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Load GPP Data
```python
from load_nfl_data_enhanced import load_nfl_data_for_optimizer_enhanced

df = load_nfl_data_for_optimizer_enhanced(
    api_key="YOUR_KEY",
    date="2025-10-20",
    season="2025REG",
    week=7,
    contest_mode='gpp_tournament'
)

# Auto-applies:
# - Ceiling projections
# - Contrarian boosts
# - Game environment factors
# - Weather penalties
```

### Example 2: Find Contrarian Plays
```python
from dfs_strategy_helpers import ContestarianEngine

contrarian = ContestarianEngine('gpp_tournament')
top_plays = contrarian.identify_contrarian_plays(df, top_n=10)

# Shows: High ceiling, low ownership, great contrarian score
print(top_plays)
```

### Example 3: Calculate Bankroll Risk
```python
from dfs_strategy_helpers import BankrollManager

bank_mgr = BankrollManager(total_bankroll=1000)
max_entries, msg = bank_mgr.calculate_max_entries('gpp_tournament', 5)

print(msg)
# 💰 Total Bankroll: $1,000.00
# 💰 Max Safe Entries: 4 (2% risk)
```

### Example 4: Build Game Stack
```python
from dfs_strategy_helpers import StackingOptimizer

stacker = StackingOptimizer('game_stack')
stack = stacker.build_game_stack(df, team1='KC', team2='BUF')

# Returns: {'QB': ['Mahomes'], 'WR': ['Hill', 'Diggs']}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For GPP Success:
1. Use the GPP enhanced file
2. Target 5-15% owned players with high ceiling
3. Stack 80% of your lineups
4. Use game stacks in high-scoring games
5. Generate 20-150 lineups (diversify)
6. Risk only 2% of bankroll

### For Cash Success:
1. Use the Cash enhanced file
2. Play high-floor players (don't care about ownership)
3. Use one clean primary stack (QB+WR)
4. Generate 1-3 lineups max
5. Risk up to 5% of bankroll
6. Target value plays

### General:
1. Always check weather before finalizing
2. Fade injured players (auto-fade does this)
3. Use Vegas totals (high = good)
4. Stack correlated players
5. Manage your bankroll
6. Track your results
