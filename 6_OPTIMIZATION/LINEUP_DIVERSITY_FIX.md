# Lineup Diversity Fix - Multiple Lineups Per Combination

## Problem
The optimizer was only generating **1 lineup per stack combination**, despite the user requesting multiple lineups (e.g., 5 or more).

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Worker Limited to 1 Lineup Per Attempt** (Line 2498)
```python
# BEFORE:
num_lineups=1,  # Generate one lineup per attempt
```
Each worker call only generated 1 lineup, so even with 5 attempts, you'd get at most 5 lineups (many duplicates).

### 2. **Artificial Lineup Limit After Generation** (Line 1491)
```python
# BEFORE:
top_lineups = stack_results[:min(len(stack_results), self.num_lineups // len(self.stack_settings))]
```
Even if multiple lineups were generated, they were being cut down to a small subset.

### 3. **Insufficient Randomization** (Line 464)
```python
# BEFORE:
diversity_factor = random.uniform(0.20, 0.50)  # 20-50% noise
noise = np.random.normal(1.0, diversity_factor, len(df))
```
Not enough variance to create truly diverse lineups.

### 4. **Low Multiplier for Candidate Generation** (Line 1437)
```python
# BEFORE:
total_candidates_needed = self.num_lineups * 2  # Only 2x
```
Only generating 2x the requested lineups wasn't enough for diversity.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix #1: Increase Worker Lineup Generation (Line 2498)
```python
# AFTER:
num_lineups=max(lineups_count, 10),  # Generate MULTIPLE lineups per attempt (min 10)
min_unique=1,  # Require at least 1 different player for diversity
```
**Impact:** Each worker now generates 10+ lineups instead of 1.

### Fix #2: Remove Artificial Lineup Limit (Line 1492)
```python
# AFTER:
top_lineups = stack_results  # Keep ALL generated lineups, not just a subset
```
**Impact:** All successfully generated lineups are kept, not artificially limited.

### Fix #3: Massive Randomization Increase (Lines 464-483)
```python
# AFTER:
diversity_factor = random.uniform(0.35, 0.70)  # MASSIVE 35-70% noise
noise = np.random.lognormal(0, diversity_factor, len(df))  # Lognormal for more variance

# Boost 3-7 random players significantly
num_boosts = random.randint(3, 7)
player_boost = np.random.choice(df.index, size=num_boosts, replace=False)
for idx in player_boost:
    noise[df.index.get_loc(idx)] *= random.uniform(1.2, 1.8)  # Bigger boost range

# Randomly penalize 2-4 players to create more variety
num_penalties = random.randint(2, 4)
player_penalty = np.random.choice(
    [i for i in df.index if i not in player_boost], 
    size=min(num_penalties, len(df) - num_boosts), 
    replace=False
)
for idx in player_penalty:
    noise[df.index.get_loc(idx)] *= random.uniform(0.6, 0.9)
```
**Impact:** 
- Noise increased from 20-50% to 35-70%
- Switched to lognormal distribution for more extreme variance
- Random player boosts (1.2-1.8x multiplier) for 3-7 players
- Random player penalties (0.6-0.9x multiplier) for 2-4 players

### Fix #4: Increase Candidate Multiplier (Lines 1438-1439)
```python
# AFTER:
total_candidates_needed = self.num_lineups * 20  # Generate 20x candidates
lineups_per_stack = max(10, total_candidates_needed // len(self.stack_settings))  # Min 10 per stack
```
**Impact:** Now generates 20x the requested lineups instead of 2x.

### Fix #5: Reduce Attempts Since Each Generates More (Line 2480)
```python
# AFTER:
max_attempts = 3  # Reduced since each attempt now generates 10+ lineups
for attempt in range(max_attempts):  # 3 attempts x 10+ lineups = 30+ total
```
**Impact:** Reduced from 5 attempts to 3, but each generates way more lineups.

### Fix #6: Auto-Include DST Players (Lines 1049-1053)
```python
# AFTER:
# IMPORTANT: Always include ALL DST players (they're usually not in manual selections)
# Users select offensive players for stacking, but DST should always be available
dst_players = df_filtered[df_filtered['Position'] == 'DST']
selected_players = df_filtered[df_filtered['Name'].isin(self.included_players)]
df_filtered = pd.concat([selected_players, dst_players]).drop_duplicates()
```
**Impact:** DST players are automatically included even when users only select offensive players.

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- User requests 5 lineups for TB (4-stack) + SEA (2-stack) + HOU (2-stack)
- Gets: **1 lineup** (maybe 2-3 if lucky)
- Most attempts generate identical lineups

### After Fix:
- User requests 5 lineups for same combination
- Gets: **30+ unique lineups** from which the best 5+ are selected
- Process:
  - 3 attempts Ã— 10 lineups per attempt = 30 lineups minimum
  - 20x multiplier ensures 100+ candidates internally
  - Massive randomization (35-70% noise + boosts/penalties) = truly unique lineups
  - All DST automatically included

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load `nfl_week7_gpp_enhanced.csv`** in the optimizer
2. **Select team stacks**: e.g., TB (4-stack), SEA (2-stack), HOU (2-stack)
3. **Request 5-10 lineups**
4. **Expected outcome**: Should get 5-10+ unique lineups with different player combinations
5. **Check diversity**: Lineups should have 2-4 different players minimum
