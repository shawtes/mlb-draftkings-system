## When to Use These Stacks

### Cash Games
- **QB + 2 (3 Team):** Safe option with moderate correlation
- Use when you believe a team will have a good offensive day but don't want to go overboard

### GPP Tournaments
- **QB + 3 (4 Team):** Good leverage play
- **QB + 4 (5 Team):** Maximum leverage, best for large-field GPPs
- **4/2 Stacks:** Use when you want specific position combinations

### Game Environment Factors

#### High Total (O/U ≥ 50 points)
- ✅ QB + 3 (4 Team)
- ✅ QB + 4 (5 Team)
- Best when you expect a shootout and want maximum exposure

#### Big Favorite (Spread ≥ 7 points)
- ✅ All new stacks work well
- Stack the favorite's offense heavily
- They should dominate time of possession and scoring

#### Dome Games
- ✅ QB + 3 (4 Team)
- ✅ 4/2: QB + 2 WR + RB + TE
- Perfect passing conditions support heavy team stacks

#### Bad Weather
- ✅ 4/2: QB + 2 WR + 2 RB
- Run-heavy game scripts favor RB stacking

## Ownership Strategy

### Chalk (High Ownership >25%)
- Use: **QB + 2 (3 Team)**
- Provides correlation without being too contrarian

### Contrarian (Low Ownership <10%)
- Use: **QB + 4 (5 Team)**
- Use: **4/2: QB + 2 WR + 2 RB**
- Use: **4/2: QB + 2 WR + RB + TE**
- Maximum leverage for GPPs

### Balanced (Medium Ownership 10-25%)
- Use: **QB + 3 (4 Team)**
- Good middle ground between correlation and uniqueness

---

## Risk Management

### Low Risk
- QB + 2 (3 Team)
- Still have 6 roster spots from other teams
- Moderate correlation benefit

### Medium Risk
- QB + 3 (4 Team)
- 5 roster spots from other teams
- Strong correlation benefit

### High Risk
- QB + 4 (5 Team)
- 4/2 Stacks
- Only 4 roster spots from other teams
- Maximum correlation, maximum variance
- Best for tournaments where you need ceiling

## Tips for Using Heavy Stacks

1. **Game Selection:** Only use heavy stacks (4-5 players) for teams in high-scoring game environments

2. **Position Diversity:** The "any" designation means the optimizer will choose the best value positions automatically

3. **Fill Rest of Lineup:** With 4-5 players from one team, diversify the remaining spots across multiple teams

4. **Tournament Sizing:** 
   - Small GPPs (≤100 entries): QB + 2 or QB + 3
   - Large GPPs (>1000 entries): QB + 4 or 4/2 stacks for maximum differentiation

5. **Ownership Leverage:** Heavy stacks provide leverage when the team is popular but the specific combination is unique

6. **Backup Plan:** Always have contingency picks if your primary stack team has late scratches

## Example Tournament Strategy

### 20 Lineup Entry
- 5 lineups: QB + 2 (3 Team) - Safer plays
- 8 lineups: QB + 3 (4 Team) - Balanced leverage
- 7 lineups: QB + 4 (5 Team) or 4/2 stacks - Max leverage

### Single Entry GPP
- Use: QB + 3 (4 Team)
- Provides good leverage without being overly risky
- Allows for diversification in remaining spots

## Stack Selection Matrix

| Stack Type | Players | Risk | Best Contest | Ownership | When to Use |
|------------|---------|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| QB + 2 (3 Team) | 3 | Low | Cash/GPP | Medium | Moderate confidence in offense |
| QB + 3 (4 Team) | 4 | Medium | GPP | Low | High confidence, want leverage |
| QB + 4 (5 Team) | 5 | High | Large GPP | Very Low | Maximum leverage, shootout |
| 4/2: QB+2WR+2RB | 5 | High | GPP | Very Low | RBBC team, run-heavy |
| 4/2: QB+2WR+RB+TE | 5 | High | GPP | Very Low | Elite offense, all positions |

## Important Notes

1. **"Any" Positions:** For QB + 2, QB + 3, and QB + 4, the optimizer will automatically select the best positions based on value and projections

2. **Complementary Stacks:** Can combine with bring-back strategies (e.g., stack 4 from Team A, add 1 from opposing Team B)

3. **Salary Considerations:** Heavy stacks often force you into value plays for remaining spots - plan accordingly

4. **Late Swap:** Monitor injury reports closely - losing one player in a 5-man stack is devastating

5. **Exposure Management:** Use the exposure controls to limit maximum exposure to these high-variance stacks

## Questions?

These stacks are now available in the **Stack Exposure** tab of the optimizer. Select the checkbox next to the stack type you want to use and set your min/max exposure percentages.

**Pro Tip:** Don't use all stacks at once. Select 2-3 stack types that fit your tournament strategy and game environment analysis.
