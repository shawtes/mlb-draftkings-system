## 🎯 OPTIMIZER SETTINGS FOR NEXT WEEK

### **Player Pool Filters:**
```
MUST INCLUDE:
- Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Drake Maye (QBs)
- Quinshon Judkins, D'Andre Swift (RBs)
- DeVonta Smith, A.J. Brown, Chris Olave (WRs)
- Browns DST, Patriots DST

EXCLUDE:
- All Bears pass catchers (unless VERY low ownership)
- Expensive RBs who disappointed (Saquon, Kamara, Breece)
- Zero-point TEs (Waller, Bowers, Mayer)
```

### **Stack Settings:**
- Use "QB + WR + TE" from PHI or KC only
- For contrarian: Use Drake Maye + Patriots DST + cheap NE WRs

### **Exposure Limits:**
- Max 40% on any single player except elite WRs (Smith, Brown)
- Max 20% on RBs (diversify)
- Min 60% on premium DST (Browns/Patriots/Panthers)

## 💡 THE BIGGEST INSIGHT

**Your optimizer picked too many "middle-tier" players who had low floors.**

The winning formula:
- 2-3 **ELITE** performers (30+ points)
- 3-4 **Solid** plays (15-25 points)
- 2-3 **Value** plays (8-12 points)
- 0 **Busts** (0-5 points)

You had too many 5-point busts. Avoid players with high bust potential!

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS

1. Update your player projections to penalize high-variance low-floor players
2. Add minimum floor thresholds (e.g., QB must have 15+ pt floor)
3. Increase weights for elite WRs in high-total games
4. Add team game total filters (target teams in 45+ O/U games)
5. Use ownership projections to fade chalk busts

**Bottom line:** Be more selective. Quality > Quantity in player pool.
