## üéØ SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED

**Combined Impact: +83.5 points average per lineup**

### **3. Improved Stacking Strategy**

**Before:**

- Often stacked weak offenses (Bears, Dolphins)
- Low correlation plays

**After:**
- Targeted high-scoring game stacks
- Only stacked proven offenses (KC, PHI, NO)
- Used 3x WR from elite offenses only

**Result:**
- WR stack average: 16.60 pts ‚Üí 83.33 pts (+66.73 pts)

```
QB:  $5,500-$6,000 (mid-tier busts)
RB:  $6,000-$7,700 (expensive disappointments)
WR:  $4,000-$5,000 (low ceiling)
TE:  $4,000-$4,500 (expensive zeros)
DST: $2,500-$3,000 (budget)
```

**Batch 2 Distribution (Optimal):**
```
QB:  $6,300-$7,000 (premium elite)     ‚úÖ +$500
RB:  $5,000-$6,000 (value plays)       ‚úÖ -$1,000

---

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### **1. Quality Over Quantity in Player Pool**
- **Before:** Selected 158+ players (too many options)
- **After:** Selected 40-50 elite/value players
- **Result:** Optimizer had better choices

### **2. Avoid "Chalky Busts"**
- Players with high ownership + bust potential = death
- Examples: Caleb Williams, Rome Odunze, Saquon Barkley
- Better: Find contrarian elite plays (Chris Olave)

### **3. Pay Up in the Right Spots**
- DST is worth spending on (+23 pts for Browns vs Dolphins)
- QB premium tier is consistent (Hurts, Mahomes)
- TE is best to pay down (Johnson $3,100 > Kelce $4,700)

### **4. Correlation Matters**
- 3x WR stack only works with elite offenses
- Game stack teams matter (PHI, KC, NO > CHI, MIA)
- RB 2x same player is risky unless elite

### **5. Floor + Ceiling Balance**
- Need 1-2 "boom" plays (DeVonta Smith 36.30)
- Need 4-5 "safe" plays (Mahomes, Judkins)
- Need 2-3 "value" plays (cheap TEs, Maye)
- Cannot have any true "busts" (0-3 pts)

---

## üöÄ PROJECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE
