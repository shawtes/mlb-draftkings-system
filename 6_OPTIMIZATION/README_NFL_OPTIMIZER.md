# NFL DFS Genetic Algorithm Optimizer

## Overview

This is a **NFL DraftKings optimizer** using genetic algorithms to create diverse, high-quality lineups. The system has been fully converted from MLB to NFL, with real DraftKings salaries and SportsData.io projections.

---

## üèà What Changed from MLB to NFL

### Position Requirements
**MLB (10 players):**
- P (2), C (1), 1B (1), 2B (1), 3B (1), SS (1), OF (3)

**NFL (9 players):**
- QB (1), RB (2), WR (3), TE (1), FLEX (1), DST (1)
- FLEX can be RB/WR/TE

### Salary Cap & Constraints
- **Salary Cap:** $50,000 (same for both sports)
- **Min Salary (MLB):** $45,000
- **Min Salary (NFL):** $48,000 (NFL requires higher minimum spending)

### Data Sources
**MLB:**
- Manual CSV uploads with player stats

**NFL:**
- **DFS Slates API** - Real DraftKings salaries
- **Projections API** - Weekly fantasy point projections
- Automated data fetching and merging

## üìÅ Key Files

### 1. `genetic_algo_nfl_optimizer.py`
The main optimizer GUI application. **Changes made:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `POSITION_LIMITS` to NFL positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, DST)
- ‚úÖ Updated `REQUIRED_TEAM_SIZE` from 10 to 9
- ‚úÖ Changed `MIN_SALARY_DEFAULT` to $48,000
- ‚úÖ Renamed class from `FantasyBaseballApp` to `FantasyFootballApp`
- ‚úÖ Updated window title to "Advanced NFL DFS Optimizer"
- ‚úÖ Changed default contest name to "NFL Main Slate"

### 2. `load_nfl_data_from_api.py`
**NEW FILE** - Fetches and prepares NFL data for the optimizer.

**Features:**
- Fetches DFS slates by date (for real DraftKings salaries)
- Fetches weekly projections (for fantasy point estimates)
- Merges salary + projection data
- Filters to valid DraftKings positions
- Calculates value metrics (Points per $1K)
- Outputs optimizer-ready CSV files

**Usage:**
```python
python3 load_nfl_data_from_api.py
```

**Output:**
- `nfl_week7_draftkings_optimizer.csv` - Ready to load in the optimizer
- `nfl_dfs_slates_2025-10-20.json` - Raw slate data for reference

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Fetch Current Week Data
```bash
cd /Users/sineshawmesfintesfaye/mlb-draftkings-system/6_OPTIMIZATION
python3 load_nfl_data_from_api.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch DraftKings slate for the specified date
2. Fetch fantasy projections for the week
3. Merge and clean the data
4. Create `nfl_week7_draftkings_optimizer.csv`

### Step 2: Run the Optimizer
```bash
python3 genetic_algo_nfl_optimizer.py
```

### Step 3: Load Your Data
1. Click **"Load Players"** in the GUI
2. Select `nfl_week7_draftkings_optimizer.csv`
3. The optimizer will validate NFL positions and salary cap

### Step 4: Configure Settings
- **Number of Lineups:** How many unique lineups to generate
- **Stack Settings:** Team stacking strategies (e.g., QB + WR from same team)
- **Exposure Limits:** Max % of lineups a player can appear in
- **Salary Constraints:** Min/max spending requirements

### Step 5: Generate Lineups
Click **"Generate Lineups"** and the genetic algorithm will:
- Create diverse, optimized lineups
- Respect position requirements (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, DST)
- Stay under $50,000 salary cap
- Maximize projected fantasy points
- Ensure lineup diversity

### Step 6: Export for DraftKings
- **Export CSV** - Upload directly to DraftKings
- Includes all required fields (player names, positions, salaries)

## üìä Data Structure

### Input CSV Format
The optimizer expects this format (created by `load_nfl_data_from_api.py`):

```csv
Name,PlayerID,Position,Team,Salary,FantasyPoints,Value
Baker Mayfield,19790,QB,TB,6600,18.63,2.82
Jared Goff,17922,QB,DET,6000,18.02,3.00
Jahmyr Gibbs,23200,RB,DET,7500,14.26,1.90
Amon-Ra St. Brown,22587,WR,DET,8200,12.60,1.54
Sam LaPorta,23141,TE,DET,4300,7.62,1.77
Seahawks,90,DST,SEA,3000,6.50,2.17
```

### Required Columns
- **Name** - Player full name
- **Position** - Must be: QB, RB, WR, TE, or DST
- **Team** - Team abbreviation (e.g., DET, TB, SEA)
- **Salary** - DraftKings salary ($3,000 - $10,000 range)
- **FantasyPoints** - Projected fantasy points
- **Value** - Points per $1,000 (FantasyPoints / Salary * 1000)

---

## üîß Configuration

### Updating for Different Weeks
Edit `load_nfl_data_from_api.py`:

```python
# Settings for upcoming week
DATE = "2025-10-27"  # Sunday games - DFS slate date
SEASON = "2025REG"   # Regular season
WEEK = 8             # Week number
```

### Position Limits (in `genetic_algo_nfl_optimizer.py`)
```python
POSITION_LIMITS = {
    'QB': 1,   # Quarterback
    'RB': 2,   # Running Back
    'WR': 3,   # Wide Receiver
    'TE': 1,   # Tight End
    'FLEX': 1, # RB/WR/TE
    'DST': 1   # Defense/Special Teams
}

FLEX_POSITIONS = ['RB', 'WR', 'TE']
```

---

## üéØ NFL-Specific Features

### 1. FLEX Position Handling
The optimizer understands that FLEX can be filled by RB, WR, or TE players. The genetic algorithm will try different combinations to maximize points.

### 2. Team Stacking
NFL DFS benefits from stacking (e.g., QB + WR from same team). The optimizer has built-in stack detection and management:
- **QB-WR stacks** - Most common and effective
- **RB-DST anti-correlation** - Avoids pairing a team's RB with their opponent's DST
- **Team exposure limits** - Prevents over-concentration

### 3. Realistic Salary Ranges
- **QB:** $4,000 - $8,000
- **RB:** $3,500 - $10,000
- **WR:** $3,000 - $10,000
- **TE:** $2,500 - $7,000
- **DST:** $2,000 - $4,500

### 4. Game Theory Optimization
The genetic algorithm creates diverse lineups to:
- Maximize your chances in GPP (tournament) play
- Avoid having all your lineups busted by one bad player
- Differentiate from the field (unique player combinations)

---

## üìà Genetic Algorithm Features

### Diversity Engine
- Creates unique lineups with controlled overlap
- Prevents duplicate or near-duplicate lineups
- Uses player exposure limits across the full lineup set

### Multi-Objective Optimization
1. **Maximize Projected Points**
2. **Maximize Salary Utilization** (reach $48K minimum)
3. **Maximize Lineup Diversity**
4. **Respect Position Requirements**

### Evolution Process
1. **Initial Population** - Generate random valid lineups
2. **Fitness Evaluation** - Score each lineup
3. **Selection** - Keep the best lineups
4. **Crossover** - Combine good lineups
5. **Mutation** - Introduce random changes for diversity
6. **Repeat** - Evolve over multiple generations

## üîë API Keys

The system uses **SportsData.io** NFL Fantasy API.

Current API key is in `load_nfl_data_from_api.py`:
```python
API_KEY = "1dd5e646265649af87e0d9cdb80d1c8c"
```

**API Endpoints Used:**
1. `DfsSlatesByDate` - Gets DraftKings salaries
2. `PlayerGameProjectionStatsByWeek` - Gets fantasy projections

---

## üìù Example Workflow

### Sunday Slate Setup (Every Week)
```bash
# 1. Update the date/week in load_nfl_data_from_api.py
# 2. Fetch fresh data
python3 load_nfl_data_from_api.py

# Output:
# ‚úÖ 104 NFL players loaded
# ‚úÖ Real DraftKings salaries from 2025-10-20
# ‚úÖ Fantasy projections for Week 7
# üíæ Saved to: nfl_week7_draftkings_optimizer.csv

# 3. Run optimizer
python3 genetic_algo_nfl_optimizer.py

# 4. In the GUI:
#    - Load nfl_week7_draftkings_optimizer.csv
#    - Set 20 lineups, 30% max exposure
#    - Enable QB-WR stacking
#    - Click "Generate Lineups"

# 5. Export and upload to DraftKings!
```

## ‚úÖ Testing

### Verify NFL Positions
```bash
python3 -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('nfl_week7_draftkings_optimizer.csv')
print(df['Position'].value_counts())
print(f'Total players: {len(df)}')
print(f'Salary range: ${df.Salary.min()} - ${df.Salary.max()}')
"
```

Expected output:
```
WR     39
RB     26
TE     23
QB     12
DST     4
Total players: 104
Salary range: $2800 - $8200
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No players loaded"
- Check that the CSV has the correct columns
- Verify positions are: QB, RB, WR, TE, DST (case-sensitive)

### "No valid lineups generated"
- Ensure you have enough players at each position
- Check salary cap settings (should be $50,000)
- Verify min salary is set correctly ($48,000 for NFL)

### "API Error: 404 Not Found"
- The date might not have a DFS slate yet
- Try a date closer to Sunday (slates usually post Thursday/Friday)
- Check that the week number matches the season

## üéì NFL DFS Strategy Tips

1. **Stack QB + WR** - When a QB throws TDs, their WRs also score
2. **Fade RB+DST same game** - If RB scores well, opponent's defense usually doesn't
3. **Target game environments** - High over/under totals = more scoring
4. **Leverage DST pricing** - Defenses are cheap and can boom/bust
5. **FLEX optimization** - Use FLEX for your best value play (RB/WR/TE)
6. **Diversify lineups** - In GPP, you want unique combinations
7. **Weather matters** - Wind/rain hurts passing, helps running
