## Stack Types Implementation Summary

### Added Stack Types

The following new stack types have been added to the MLB DFS Optimizer:

1. **5 Stack** - 5 players from one team
2. **4 Stack** - 4 players from one team  
3. **3 Stack** - 3 players from one team
4. **No Stacks** - No stacking constraints (players from any teams)

### Where These Are Available

#### 1. Stack Exposure Tab
- Updated to include "5", "4", "3", and "No Stacks" options at the top of the list
- Full list now: `["5", "4", "3", "No Stacks", "4|2|2", "4|2", "3|3|2", "3|2|2", "2|2|2", "5|3", "5|2"]`

#### 2. Team Combinations Tab  
- Updated stack type dropdown to include the new simple stack options
- Full list now: `["5", "4", "3", "No Stacks", "5|2", "4|2", "4|2|2", "3|3|2", "3|2|2", "2|2|2", "5|3"]`
- Default selection changed from "4|2" to "4" (4 Stack)
- Updated tooltip to explain both simple and complex stack patterns

#### 3. Team Stacks Tab
- Already supported "3 Stack", "4 Stack", "5 Stack" tabs
- "No Stacks" option will use no stacking constraints

### Implementation Details

#### Stack Processing Logic
- **Simple Stacks ("5", "4", "3")**: Enforces exactly N players from one selected team
- **No Stacks**: Applies no stacking constraints, uses only position and salary constraints
- **Complex Stacks ("4|2", "3|3|2", etc.)**: Enforces multiple stack sizes simultaneously

#### Team Selection Integration
- All new stack types integrate with existing team selection system
- Supports multiple team selection formats:
  - Integer keys (5, 4, 3)
  - String keys ("5", "4", "3")
  - Dash format ("5-Stack", "4-Stack", "3-Stack")
  - Space format ("5 Stack", "4 Stack", "3 Stack")
  - All stacks ("all" key)

#### Optimization Features
- **PuLP Integration**: All stack types use the same robust PuLP optimization engine
- **Advanced Risk Management**: New stacks work with advanced quantitative optimization
- **Adaptive Constraints**: If selected teams don't have enough players, the system provides warnings
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when team selections are invalid

### Testing
- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Stack type parsing verified
- ✅ Stack determination logic tested
- ✅ Application launches successfully
- ✅ UI integration confirmed

### Usage Instructions

1. **For Simple Stacks**: 
   - Go to Team Combinations tab
   - Select "5", "4", or "3" from the stack type dropdown
   - Select your desired teams in the Team Stacks tab
   - Generate lineups

2. **For No Stacks**:
   - Select "No Stacks" from any stack type dropdown
   - No team selection needed
   - System will create lineups with players from any teams

3. **Mix with Complex Stacks**:
   - Can combine simple and complex stack types in the same optimization run
   - Use Stack Exposure tab to control the mix of different stack types

The new stack types provide more flexibility for DFS lineup construction while maintaining the same robust optimization and risk management features.
