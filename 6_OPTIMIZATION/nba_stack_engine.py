NBA Stack Engine - Professional DFS Stacking Strategy
======================================================

Based on MIT Research: "How to Win at Daily Fantasy Sports"
and Fantasy Sports Bible best practices.

Key Research Insights Implemented:
1. Opponent Portfolio Modeling (Dirichlet-multinomial)
2. Mean-Variance Optimization for GPP tournaments
3. Correlation-based stacking (PG-Wing, PG-C, Game stacks)
4. Ownership differentiation for tournament play
5. Kelly Criterion for optimal exposure
6. Bring-back strategies for game stacks
