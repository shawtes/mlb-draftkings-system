TEST INSTRUCTIONS FOR 60 LINEUP FIX
===================================

1. SETUP:
   ✅ Load your player CSV
   ✅ Check "Disable Kelly Sizing" 
   ✅ Set Min Unique to 0 or 1
   ✅ Go to Team Combinations tab

2. CREATE TEST COMBINATION:
   ✅ Add combination: e.g., LAD(4) + SF(2)
   ✅ Set lineups to 60 (or whatever you want)
   ✅ Check the combination checkbox
   ✅ Click "Generate Combination Lineups"

3. LOOK FOR DEBUG MESSAGES:
   ✅ "🔍 DEBUG: COMBINATION MODE ACTIVATED for 60 lineups"
   ✅ "🔍 GENETIC ENGINE CHECK" with details
   ✅ "🧬 COMBINATION MODE: FORCING 60 lineups"
   ✅ "🧬 DUPLICATING lineup X as lineup Y" (if needed)

4. EXPECTED RESULT:
   ✅ Should get exactly 60 lineups
   ✅ May see duplication messages if not enough unique lineups
   ✅ Final count should match requested count

5. IF STILL NOT WORKING:
   ✅ Check that "Disable Kelly Sizing" is actually checked
   ✅ Verify Min Unique is 0 or 1
   ✅ Look for any error messages in logs
   ✅ Report what debug messages you see
