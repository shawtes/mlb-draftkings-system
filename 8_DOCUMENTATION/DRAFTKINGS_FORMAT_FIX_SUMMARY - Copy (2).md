# DraftKings Entries File Format Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved âœ…

Your DraftKings entries file had malformed data where:
- Instructions were mixed into data rows instead of being separate
- Contest metadata was in wrong columns (Contest ID in Entry Fee column)
- Missing proper column structure

## What Was Fixed ðŸ”§

### 1. **Format Detection Enhanced**
- Now properly detects official DraftKings contest format
- Recognizes the exact structure: `Entry ID,Contest Name,Contest ID,Entry Fee,P,P,C,1B,2B,3B,SS,OF,OF,OF,,Instructions`
- Handles 2 pitcher positions and 3 outfield positions correctly

### 2. **Player ID Extraction Improved**
- Extracts player mappings from "Name + ID" column in the player pool data
- Properly parses "Name (ID)" format like "Hunter Brown (39204162)"
- Fallback matching for players not found in exact mapping

### 3. **Official DK Format Handler Added**
- `format_lineup_for_official_dk_format()` method specifically for DraftKings contest files
- Positions filled in exact order: P, P, C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, OF, OF, OF
- Uses only player IDs (numbers) as required by DraftKings

### 4. **UI Enhancements**
- **ðŸ”§ Fix Malformed DK Entries File** button to repair broken files
- **Fill Entries with Optimized Lineups** button with improved logic
- Better error messages and success feedback
