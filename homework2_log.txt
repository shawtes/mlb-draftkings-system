OBSERVATIONS:
-------------
1. Both programs successfully displayed process IDs and parent process IDs
2. Group ID was correctly retrieved in both implementations
3. The grep command for /etc/passwd did not return results on this system
   (This is expected on macOS and some Linux systems where user accounts
    are managed differently)
4. The ps command showed process lists before and after the 3-second sleep
5. Process lists were similar but not identical between the two runs
6. The C program shows process ID 64395 while running
7. The shell script shows process ID 64656 while running

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN C AND SHELL IMPLEMENTATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------
1. C program requires compilation; shell script runs directly
2. C program uses system calls (getpid, getppid, getuid, getgid)
3. Shell script uses environment variables ($$, $PPID, $USER, $UID, $GID)
4. Both achieve the same functional results with different approaches
