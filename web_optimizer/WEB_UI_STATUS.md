- Immediate feedback
- Local file operations

### Web (React):
- Modern, glassmorphic design
- Cyan/slate color scheme
- More spaced out
- API-based operations

## 🔧 Blank Page Issue

**Problem:** You're seeing a blank page
**Cause:** Likely Firebase initialization error or missing component

**Solution Steps:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors in Console tab
3. Most likely: Firebase auth failing

- Reduce padding/spacing
- Show more players at once
- Compact tables

### 2. Improve Color Scheme

### 3. Add Desktop Features

- Save/load configurations

### 4. Simplify Navigation
- Make tabs more prominent
- Reduce fancy animations
- Focus on functionality
