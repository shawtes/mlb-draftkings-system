Within the dfs optimizer component
excellent work only no errors

within the control panel- make it slightly wider- enlargen the file operations buttonsand give them a basic enterprise level style - give the optimization, salary, sorting, actions, generated teams,and favorites all color coded and give it more padding and proper borders within each box in the control panel- that means vertically  and within the control panel container horizontally itself 

within team combination- modify ui for the select teams tabs- increase size of select/deselect teams- keep the emojis within those boxes and remove the rest of the emojis from the team combinations tab - i dont like emojis unless its in select/deselect team buttons- make custom style for the box for team name and selection box
remove emoji from stack settings text as well- and make stack settings a custom ui component with professional and enerprise level style- take inspiration from top faang company industry standard
remove emoji next to generated combinations
increase size/readability of text all throughout tab
on the actions box within generated combinations- remove hover effect give it a different basic style and increase size of select box for the combination its small
