excellent work only no errors follow industry standard practices

read through the optimization folder

there should contain 3 different optimizers

one for nfl, mlb, and nba

create a howtoforcarter.md within components to explain how the backend optimizer files are connected to the frontend and also explain how the optimzation works for nfl- im confused on what the different generations/optimizations/team combinations/stacks im confused 

im still getting this error:
‚ùå Optimization failed: Not enough players available for position DST. Need 1, have 0


currently this optimization folders backend implentation for nfl should be implemented within the nfl state of dfs optimizer- confirm that the generated teams within team combinations are actually being generated by backend and not a frontend ui component 

within the control panel of dfsoptimizer remove the frontend only ui components under the run combinations/generated teams section- there are 5 teams generated as a frontend only ui- make that connected to the generated team combinations
