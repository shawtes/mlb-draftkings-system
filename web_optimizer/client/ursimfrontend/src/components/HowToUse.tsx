          answer: 'Click "Stack Exposure" tab. You will see a list of stack types (5, 4, 3, 2, No Stacks). Check the box next to "4" to enable 4-player stacks.

          question: '‚ö†Ô∏è Common Beginner Mistakes',
          answer: 'Mistake 1: Selecting too few players (under 30) - this limits diversity. Mistake 2: Not enabling any stack types - stacking is crucial for correlation. Mistake 3: Using too high min exposure - this forces players into too many lineups. Mistake 4: Setting number of lineups too high on first try - start with 20-50. Mistake 5: Not checking team stacks - always verify your stack selections before running.'

          question: 'üí° Quick Tips for Beginners',
          answer: 'Tip 1: Start simple - use just the Players tab and Stack Exposure tab for your first few runs. Tip 2: Focus on 4-stacks - they offer good correlation without being too risky. Tip 3: Select players with high "Value" scores - these are the most efficient. Tip 4: Generate 20-50 lineups to start - enough for diversity without being overwhelming. Tip 5: Review the "By Run" breakdown in My Entries tab to track your optimization sessions.'
        },
        {
          question: '‚ùì Troubleshooting',
          answer: 'Problem: "No lineups generated" - Make sure you selected enough players (30+) and enabled at least one stack type. Problem: "All lineups look the same" - Increase Min Unique setting in Control Panel. Problem: "Optimization taking too long" - Reduce number of lineups or simplify stack settings. Problem: "Players not loading" - Check CSV format (must have Name, Team, Position, Salary, Predicted_DK_Points columns).'
